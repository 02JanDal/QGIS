<h3>Coordinate Reference System Selector</h3>

<p>
  The Coordinate Reference System Selector allows you to set the projection for
  the current layer.
</p>
<p>
  You can find a coordinate system by entering its name, EPSG code or the QGIS ID
  and clicking the <label>Find</label> button. The list of recently used
  coordinate systems will be available on the bottom for quick access.
</p>
<p>
  When operating across layers, for example, computing intersections between
  two layers, it is important that both layers have the same CRS. To change the
  projection of an existing layer, it is insufficient to simply change the CRS
  in that layer's properties. Instead you must save the layer as a new layer,
  and choose the desired CRS for the new layer.
