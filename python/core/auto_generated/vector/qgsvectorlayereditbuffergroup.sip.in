class QgsVectorLayerEditBufferGroup : QObject

%Docstring(signature="appended")

The edit buffer group manages a group of edit buffers. Commands like commit and rollback are
managed by the group invokes individual :py:func:`~addFeature`, :py:func:`~deleteFeature`, ... in the correct order
across all contained edit buffers.

    bool startEditing();

    bool commitChanges( bool stopEditing, QStringList &commitErrors );
%Docstring
Attempts to commit any changes to disk.  Returns the result of the attempt.
If a commit fails, the in-memory changes are left alone.

This allows editing to continue if the commit failed on e.g. a
disallowed value in a Postgres database - the user can re-edit and try
again.

The commits occur in distinct stages,
(add attributes, add features, change attribute values, change
geometries, delete features, delete attributes)
so if a stage fails, it's difficult to roll back cleanly.
Therefore any error message also includes which stage failed so
that the user has some chance of repairing the damage cleanly.
%End

    bool rollBack();
%Docstring
Stop editing and discard the edits
