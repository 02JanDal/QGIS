class QgsBasemapPathRegistry
{
%Docstring
A registry class to hold paths of basemaps
Paths are meant to be absolute paths and are stored by order of preference.

If a layer from one of the paths is loaded, it will be saved as basemap in the project file.
For instance, if you have C:\my_maps in your basemap paths,
C:\my_maps\my_country\ortho.tif will be save in your project as basemap:my_country\ortho.tif

The resolving of the file paths happens in QgsPathResolver.

    QString fullPath( const QString &relativePath ) const;

Returns the full path if the file has been found in one of the paths, an empty string otherwise

Returns the relative path if the file has been found in one of the path, an empty string otherwise

Returns a list of registered basemap paths
%End


    void registerPath( const QString &path, int position = -1 );
%Docstring
Registers a basemap path
If ``position`` is given, the path is inserted at the given position in the list
Since the paths are stored by order of preference, lower positions in the list take precedence.
%End

    void unregisterPath( const QString &path );
%Docstring
Unregisters a basemap path
