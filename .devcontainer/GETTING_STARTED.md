# Getting started with _dev containers_ for QGIS

This repository provides a number of [_dev containers_](https://containers.dev/) for QGIS development.

A _dev container_ is a pre-configured Docker container that can help you get up and running very quickly.

There are several ways to run a _dev container_:

* GitHub Codespaces (VS Code)
* CodeSandbox (VS Code)
* Gitpod (VS Code)

## Available containers

There are four containers ready for you to use:

* Qt 5
* Qt 6
